==============

This repository was forked from a stripped down version of [Henry Roe's Xenics XEVA near-infrared camera control software](https://github.com/henryroe/xenics_pluto) originally built for Pluto occultation observations.

The goal of this fork is to try to replace xenics xeneth or x-control software.
